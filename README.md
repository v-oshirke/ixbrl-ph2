# AI Document Processor (ADP)

## Description
AI Document Processor Accelerator is designed to help companies leverage LLMs to automate document and file processing tasks. The accelerator uses bicep templates to provision Azure Function App, Storage account, and static web app to manage your documents life cycle from raw PDF, word doc, or .mp3, extract meaningful entities and insights, and write an output report, CSV, or JSON to a blob storage container. 

## Business Value
- *Developer Foundation* -  AI Document Processor is intended to serve as an initial foundation to build your workflow on top of. Developers can write custom logic within the azure functions and leverage existing utility functions to write to blob and call Azure OpenAI models.
- *Business User UI* - Business users can leverage the UI to update prompts and files to immediately test the results.
- *Automated Infrastructure Provisioning* - The bicep templates spin up the required infrastructure and builds a deployment pipeline for Azure Functions and the Static Web App 
- *RBAC Configuration* - The bicep templates spin up infrastructure with managed identities and appropriate access to reduce initial overhead tasks such as granting permissions between services. 

## Resources

## Pre-Requisites
- az cli
- azd cli
- npm 9.x.x
- node 18.x.x
- Python 3.11
  
## Instructions

1. Fork repo to your GH account
2. Clone your forked repo
3. To deploy bicep template run:
  - azd auth login
  - az login
  - azd up
  - Enter your forked GH repo link `https://github.com/{your_user_name}/llm-doc-processing`
  - Enter your User Principal ID when prompted
  - To get your User principal ID run `az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv`

### Deploy Static Web App from CLI
1. Check SWA configuration `swa-cli.config.json`
   - Ensure SWA CLI is intalled `npm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli`
   - Ensure apiLocation = ""
   - Resulting swa-cli.config should look like:
   - `{
        "$schema": "https://aka.ms/azure/static-web-apps-cli/schema",
        "configurations": {
          "ai-document-processor-v1": {
            "appLocation": "frontend",
            "apiLocation": "",
            "outputLocation": "dist",
            "dataApiLocation": "frontend/swa-db-connections",
            "apiLanguage": "python",
            "apiVersion": "3.8",
            "appBuildCommand": "npm run build",
            "run": "npm run dev",
            "appDevserverUrl": "http://localhost:5173"
          }
        }
      }`
    - If changes are desired `swa init` may be run
3. `swa build`
4. `swa deploy --env Production -d {deployment_token}`
     - Retrieve deployment token from overview page of the static web app in Azure portal under "Manage Deployment Token"
